autotranslator
==============

Start of Auto Translator

Requires <a href=https://bitbucket.org/zhuoqiang/goslate/raw/tip/goslate.py>goslate.py</a>


How it works:

1. Create a file consisting of comma separated values called in.csv
2. Write the languages that you'd like to translate
3. Run generate.py

I've included an example in.csv file
